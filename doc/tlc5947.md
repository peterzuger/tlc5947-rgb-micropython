# TLC5947 RGB LED driver

## tlc5947.tlc5947(spi, xlat, blank)
Constructs a tlc5947 object with the given spi bus and config pins for
the tlc5947. The SPI object must be configured before it is given to
the constructor, this allows any SPI config to be used with this
module. The `xlat`/`blank` pins must also be configured before they
are passed to the constructor.

```python
from tlc5947 import tlc5947
from pyb import SPI, Pin

spi = SPI(2, SPI.MASTER, baudrate=20000000)
xlat = Pin(Pin.board.TLC5947_XLAT, Pin.OUT_PP)
blank = Pin(Pin.board.TLC5947_BLANK, Pin.OUT_OD)

tlc = tlc5947(spi, xlat, blank)
```

The SPI baudrate can be chosen anywhere at or below 20000000, since
this is the fastest baudrate supported by the tlc5947. If possible it
should be as chosen as high as possible.

The minimum SPI baudrate is calculated as follows:
```python
frequency = 100 # see __call__
bits = 288      # the tlc buffer is 288 bits
minumum_baudrate = frequency * (bits + bits * 0.1)
```

This leaves barely any room for other applications and should only be
used when absolutely required.

This setup allows the `tlc5947` object to be used without requiring
any knowledge about the `xlat` or `blank` pins or how to configure the
SPI peripheral.


### tlc5947.tlc5947().\_\_call\_\_() -> None
This is the call() method of the tlc5947 object, it is the method that
causes anything to happen, all other methods just read/write the
internal state. When this method is called, every pattern is advanced
one step forward all LED's are updated with their new colors if there
are new colors, and then they are written out to the TLC5947 device
and latched onto the Gray-scale registers.

This method should be called in regular intervals, the exact frequency
depends on the particular application. The frequency must be a
multiple of the fastest desired update rate.

example: If you want to fade an LED from one to another color in 100
steps, in 1 second, the frequency must be N*100Hz. N can be 1, there
is no reason for a faster frequency if it is not needed. But be aware
that any change will happen at this frequency.

```python
from pyb import Timer

timer = Timer(7, freq=100) # call 100 times per second
timer.callback(tlc)        # register the __call__ method
```

Any reference to `tick` in this documentation refers to this, in this
example the frequency of the timer is the tick rate of the driver.


### tlc5947.tlc5947().blank(self, val) -> None
This method just sets and clears the BLANK pin of the TLC5947 device.
Use this method and not the pyb.Pin() directly, since this makes it
possible for the driver to stop sending the data over the SPI bus
while the driver is BLANK'ed.

This optimization is not implemented for now, but it is possible.


### tlc5947.tlc5947().set(self, leds, pattern) -> int
This method set's LED's or a single led to a specific pattern. The
leds can be given as a single int representing an individual led, or a
list of int's representing any number of led's.

The pattern is a string that must be a valid Pattern format.
For a description of the Pattern format see [this](format.md).

```python
pid1 = tlc.set(1, "#FF0000")
pid2 = tlc.set([2, 3, 4], "#FF0000")
pid3 = tlc.set([7], "#FF0000")
```

This method returns a so called pattern ID. This pattern ID can be
used in the next methods to refer back to the pattern set here.


### tlc5947.tlc5947().replace(self, pattern\_id, pattern) -> int
This method can be used to replace an existing pattern with a new
pattern while keeping the same pattern ID.

```python
pid = tlc.set(1, "@;") # set a transparent and infinite pattern
                       # this basically reserves the pattern ID

# do other stuff

tlc.replace(pid, "#F0F0F0;")
```

This method returns the same pid that was passed in.

Why this method is usefull is described [here](format.md).


### tlc5947.tlc5947().delete(self, pattern\_id) -> bool
This method deletes a pattern, returns true on success.

If this method returns false, the pattern ID either did not exist or
was not valid.

Infinite Patterns (see [here](format.md)) can only be removed directly
with this method (Or by replacing it by a finite pattern).


### tlc5947.tlc5947().get(self, led) -> str
This method return's the current color of the LED.

The color is taken directly from the internal copy of the tlc5947
buffer. If a pattern is running that changes the RGB value of the
LED, this method can be used to get the current color.

```
from time import sleep

# color fade from red to black(off)
pid = tlc.set(1, "<5[#FF0000<10[|50\b-0.1-]>-|50]")

while tlc.exists(pid):
    # Print the current RGB value of LED 1
    print(tlc.get(1))
    sleep(0.05)
```


### tlc5947.tlc5947().exists(self, pattern\_id) -> bool
This checks if the pattern ID given exists and is still in use. This
can be used for timed patterns to see when they are finished.

```python
# This pattern takes 50 ticks
pid1 = tlc.set(1, "#FF0000|50#0000FF")

while tlc.exists(pid):
    pass
print("Pattern Done")
```

It is important to keep in mind that pattern ID's while they are
unique, meaning one pattern ID refers to one pattern, they can be
reused.
The pattern ID is a unsigned 16bit integer, the ID's are sequential
starting at 1 and once ID 65535 is reached overflowing back to 1.


### tlc5947.tlc5947().set\_id\_map(self, map) -> None
This method allows the order of the LED's to be remapped to a
different LED index.

The default configuration maps LED D1 to index 1 e.g.:

<p align="center"><img src="doc/schematic.png" alt="doc/schematic.png"></p>

```python
tlc.set(1, "#0000FF;") # LED D1
tlc.set(3, "#00FF00;") # LED D3
tlc.set(6, "#FF0000;") # LED D6
```

If your application arranges the LED's differently, it may be easier
to address the LED's in a different order. This can be achieved with
the `id_map`.

```python
map = [4, 3, 2, 1, -1, -1, 7, 8]

tlc.set_id_map(map)

tlc.set(1, "#0000FF;") # LED D4
tlc.set(3, "#00FF00;") # LED D2
tlc.set(6, "#FF0000;") # -> ValueError("led not in id_map")
```
